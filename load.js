Benefits of Primary Physical Custody
Post by Christopher Migliaccio

Table of Contents
Primary physical custody of children has many benefits, along with legal custody standards and considerations specific to Texas law. The post-divorce arrangements concerning children’s well-being in Texas cannot be overstated. It fundamentally influences the child’s emotional stability, psychological development, and overall quality of life. Understanding primary custody’s advantages is necessary for a child to grow in a supportive environment.

This document explores the many benefits of primary physical custody for children, underscored by legal precedents and considerations. It aims to dissect how such custody arrangements can foster a stable and secure atmosphere critical for a child’s development. Additionally, the role of the primary caregiver in nurturing the child’s academic, social, and emotional growth will be examined in detail. By exploring these crucial points, the document will provide invaluable insights into how primary physical custody is a foundational pillar for a child’s prosperous future post-divorce.

Establishing a Stable Environment
One of the fundamental benefits of primary physical custody is its role in providing a stable and predictable environment for the child. This stability is crucial during their formative years, contributing to a sense of security and well-being. Living primarily with one parent ensures that the child doesn’t have to constantly adapt to different homes or sets of expectations, which can be confusing and stressful. A stable living environment facilitates a smoother academic and social life, typically involving consistent schools, communities, and peer groups.

Promoting Consistent Care and Routine
Consistency in care and daily routines is another significant advantage of primary physical custody. A regular schedule, including set times for meals, homework, and bedtime, helps children feel safe and grounded. It fosters their ability to trust their caretakers and the world around them. Consistent care goes beyond the basics of physical well-being to include emotional and intellectual support.

In a primary child custody arrangement, the primary caregiver is better positioned to understand and meet the child’s changing needs, thereby fostering a nurturing environment conducive to growth and learning.

Fostering a Strong Parent-Child Bond
Establishing and maintaining a strong bond between the parent and child is pivotal, and primary child custody arrangements are particularly beneficial in this regard. Such arrangements ensure that the child spends substantial time with the primary caregiver, which is vital for bonding.

Frequent and routine interactions help develop a deep, enduring relationship built on mutual love, respect, and understanding. This bond is the foundation for the child’s emotional and social development, influencing their relationships with others as they grow.

Encouraging Emotional Security
Finally, primary physical custody plays a critical role in creating an emotionally secure environment for the child to thrive. Emotional security is the bedrock upon which children build their self-esteem, resilience, and independence. Knowing they have a stable home and a primary custodial parent gives children the confidence to explore, learn, and take on new challenges. Children are more likely to express their feelings, seek support when needed, and develop healthy coping mechanisms in such an environment. This emotional foundation supports not only their immediate well-being but also their long-term psychological health.

Confident student with a backpack holding a clipboard and pencil in a modern classroom setting.

When you turn 18, you legally become an adult in Texas. With this major milestone, you gain new freedoms and responsibilities. Suddenly, you can vote, marry, open your own bank account, sign contracts, and enlist in the military. You are also legally independent from your parents. This means they can no longer access your medical records, manage your finances, or make critical decisions on your behalf. You are now in charge of your life, and with that comes the need to think about your future and protecting yourself in ways you might not have before. Below, our Texas estate planning lawyers answer the critical question, “What legal documents should an 18-year-old have?”

Essential Legal Documents for an 18-Year-Old
Lacking essential estate planning documents can leave your parents or loved ones in a bind, unable to assist you with medical or financial matters in an emergency. Setting up certain documents can ensure that the people you trust can advocate for you and make decisions on your behalf if needed. We recommend having a simple estate plan that contains the following documents:

Medical power of attorney
HIPAA release
Financial power of attorney
Last will and testament
Medical Power of Attorney
A medical power of attorney is a legal document that allows someone you choose to make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you cannot. This person is a medical agent. 

This document becomes critical if you are unconscious, severely injured, or incapacitated due to illness. Your medical agent will be able to talk to your healthcare providers and make medical treatment decisions for you. 

You can designate one or more people you trust to be your medical agent. Whether you choose your parents, or another loved one, a medical agent can advocate for you when you cannot advocate for yourself.  

HIPAA Release
Once you turn 18, your medical information becomes protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Without your written authorization, your healthcare providers are legally prohibited from sharing your health status, treatment recommendations, or medical records with anyone, including your parents.

Unlike a medical power of attorney, a HIPAA release grants no decision-making powers. Instead, it allows the individuals you select to talk to your healthcare providers and access your medical records. This access can become critical in medical emergencies, like if you are unconscious or incapacitated, where informed decisions about your health must be made.

A HIPAA release is critical if you want someone you trust, like your parents or another loved one, to be informed about your health and involved in a medical emergency. However, a HIPAA release does not have to be all-inclusive. Depending on your comfort level, you can grant broad access to your medical information or limit it. 

Financial Power of Attorney
A financial power of attorney is a legal document that allows you to designate one or more people to manage your financial matters if you cannot do so yourself. Generally, it allows someone you trust to help you with financial tasks. For example, your financial agent may be able to do the following on your behalf:

Access your bank accounts
Pay your rent and utility bills
Pay any other bills you have, such as a car loan, credit card bills, or student loan bills
Renew your car registration
File your taxes
Make financial decisions
You can choose when a financial power of attorney goes into effect, whether immediately, which may be helpful for convenience, or only in the event of incapacitation. You can also limit or expand your agent’s powers and change or update the document at any time when you have a sound mind.

Why is establishing a financial power of attorney important? Without one, in the event of incapacitation, your parents or loved ones would have to go through a lengthy court process to get guardianship rights and the authority to manage your finances. In the meantime, your financial obligations may go unmanaged, leading to serious consequences. For example, you could face late fees, eviction, and credit damage.

Last Will and Testament
A will is a legal document that outlines your wishes regarding the distribution of your assets and belongings after you pass away. It may seem premature to think about a will at 18. However, having one can benefit anyone, regardless of age or assets. You may find that you have possessions of sentimental or even monetary value that you want to leave to certain people.

If you pass away in Texas without a will, state law determines how to distribute your estate. State law may not align with your wishes. You can provide clear instructions for your assets and property by creating a simple will. 

Keep in mind that once you establish a will, you can modify it as needed when significant life changes occur or as your assets grow. You should revisit your estate planning documents every couple of years to ensure the documents continue to meet your needs.

        TITLE: "Notice of Appraised Value",
        CONTENT: `The day has arrived! You look forward to it every year; ok, dread could be a better description for most. In your mailbox is your property’s new Notice of Appraised Value, lovingly constructed, sealed, and sent to you by your local appraisal district. Do you rip it up and throw it away in disgust, or stick it on your refrigerator as a reminder for later like a ‘20% Off Your Entire Purchase’ coupon at your favorite store? Hopefully what you read below will help you decide that. This article takes a deeper look at what the tax code says about the Notice of Appraised Value, how to get the most from them, and why receiving one shouldn’t ruin your whole summer.

        Texas Property Tax Code
        The rule book when it comes to anything property tax related in Texas is the Texas Property Tax Code. It outlines everything from appraisal methods used, record keeping requirements by appraisal districts, and tax liens for delinquent payers. It’s the Bible of Texas property taxes, and what it says must be followed.
        
        What does the Texas Property Tax Code say about a Notice of Appraised Value? I’m glad I asked. It mentions many things, but some things are WAY more important than others. First, it’s important to know under what circumstances you will receive a Notice of Appraised Value (Notice) from your local appraisal district. Tax code specifically says that an appraisal district is not required to send you an annual appraisal Notice unless: 1) Your new market value for the year is more than $1,000 higher than it was the preceding year -OR- 2) The property in question wasn’t on the appraisal roll, which is the county’s record system, in the previous year -OR- 3) There was a change in the exemption status from the previous year that results in more taxes (PTC 25.19a,e).
        
        You’d be surprised how many people don’t know the ‘$1,000 or greater’ rule and when they don’t receive a Notice they call us up in July and say “can I still file a protest?” The short answer 99.9% of the time is “no, it’s too late to file a protest”. I’ve seen this argument shut-down more times than I can count in a hearing to determine if a late protest should be allowed. Just because you weren’t made aware of your current year value and didn’t receive a Notice, due to one of the three previously listed reasons, doesn’t mean you have valid cause to file a late protest after the protest deadline (which is May 15th for most). In fact, I tell almost anyone who asks me about Notices to ignore the snail mail system and just check their value on the appraisal district’s website starting in early April. Often the county website will tell you everything you need to know including the deadline to file a protest. It may even offer you a digital copy of your Notice.
        
        So, what else does tax code say about Notices? Great question. Tax code says that there must be very specific pieces of information on all official Notices. I have to say official Notices because some counties will send unofficial postcards to property owners who are not required to receive an official Notice based on the criteria I mentioned previously. But unlike postcards, true Notices are required to show the following: your property identification, your taxing entities, the current and previous year’s appraised value and taxable value accounting for exemptions, an estimate of taxes based on that value and the latest know tax rates, and a glance of your value from 5 years ago along with the percentage change your property value has made since then. If you have an exemption that freezes taxes for a certain entity, that frozen amount should be indicated as well. The district is also required to break down land value versus improvement value, meaning any structure that has been built on the land itself.
        
        
        
        On top of all of that information that is super specific to your property, a Notice will include statements about local appraisal, tax rate creation, and rate adoption. They are required to let you know that property taxes are a local issue so that you don’t call the State to complain about your value or taxes. And they’re right, you won’t get anywhere calling the State about that stuff.
        
        
        
        This is all well and good information they are providing, but why shouldn’t I just rip up and throw away this statement? Hang with me, I haven’t mentioned the most important piece of information provided on Notices. All Notices are required to provide detailed instructions on how, by what means, and by when you may file a protest to dispute the current value which includes a Notice of Protest form with instructions on how to complete it and send it back to the appraisal district (PTC 25.19g, j).
        
        
        
        What does that mean for me? It means you can protest that value if you aren’t happy with it... regardless of previous years’ value or prior results. Collect sales data, property damage photos, repair bids, and other evidence to make your case (see also How to Protest Your Property Taxes). Property owners are sometimes treated more favorably than property tax agents at the appraisal district; use that to your advantage. Be polite but compelling. You may be surprised with the results of your protest.
        
        Hire The Pros
        Or don’t protest yourself and hire a pro to do it for you. You mean like Resolute Property Tax Solutions? EXACTLY! But at least exercise your right to dispute your property value. It’s just like voting. You can’t complain later about your property taxes if you didn’t do anything about them when you had the chance. Well you can, but it’d be insincere and annoying.
        
        At least 20 times a year I hear a prospective client say, “I don’t think I have a good case, why bother protesting?” The simple answer is doing nothing results in nothing 100% of the time when it comes to property taxes. You’ll really never know unless you try. And the beauty of our service, aside from time saved and professional service, is that we don’t charge you a dime if we’re unsuccessful in saving you money. That’s what you would call a No-Lose scenario.

    How Much Does a Will Cost in Texas?
Post by Christopher Migliaccio

Table of Contents
Document titled "testament" with text about the last will, accompanied by u.s. currency notes.

There is a common misconception that estate planning is only for wealthy or older people. However, having a will can benefit anyone, regardless of financial status or age. You can use a will to appoint a guardian for minor children, provide for your family, and safeguard your legacy. Recognizing the importance of this document, you may wonder, “How much does a will cost in Texas?” Below, our Texas estate planning lawyers discuss the cost of a will in Texas and our Estate Plan Express service.

What Is a Will in Texas?
A will is a legal document that specifies how your assets should be distributed after you pass away. It allows you to choose your beneficiaries and what they should receive from your estate. It also allows you to designate an executor or the person to manage your estate and carry out your wishes after death.

Life is unpredictable, and unforeseen events can happen at any age. Even if you do not believe you have any significant assets, you likely have possessions of sentimental or monetary value that you wish to leave to specific people. For parents, you can use a will to name a guardian for minor children in the event that both parents pass. 

If you die without a will, it is called dying intestate. In this situation, Texas intestacy laws apply and will decide the distribution of your estate. If you do not have another estate planning document in place that names a guardian for your minor children, the court will decide on guardianship. Texas law may not align with your wishes. 

How Much Does It Cost to Make a Will in Texas?
The cost of a will in Texas can vary widely based on several factors, including the method you choose to create your will and the complexity of your estate. For example, a DIY will kit may seem like the cheapest option over hiring a lawyer, but it comes with serious risks. Without professional oversight, you may leave gaps in your estate plan or make errors that could lead to the will being invalidated or easily contested.

However, hiring a lawyer to create your will could cost thousands of dollars, right? While some Texas law firms may charge thousands of dollars to make your will, at Warren & Migliaccio, we offer a flat fee will package for Texans. 

Our Texas estate planning law firm offers a convenient online will preparation service called Estate Plan Express. With this service, you get professional document preparation from a licensed attorney and assurance that your will is legally sound at affordable prices. 

Our fee varies depending on whether you prepare your will documents as single or married. We charge $599 for single adults and $799 for married couples.

Our Estate Plan Express service is online and is ideal for individuals or families across Texas who need a simple estate plan. It includes four essential estate planning documents:

Last will and testament
Financial power of attorney
Medical power of attorney

She’s reasonable and fair most of the time,” Steve said to his father. “We make good business partners, but there’s just no love left, heck, we barely even like each other anymore, and I need to move on before I get too old to find somebody else.”
        
        “Yeah, I’ve heard that story before,” his father said, “but if you get along as business partners, you might be able to save some cash and skip the nasty legal battle. Jimmy was in a similar situation and he used a divorce mediator.”

        Understanding Divorce Mediation and Its Benefits
        Understanding divorce mediation and its benefits, including the role of a mediator versus a lawyer in divorce.
        
        If you’re navigating the rough waters of divorce, mediation might just be your lifeline. It’s a private process where both parties come together with a professionally trained neutral mediator to hash out their differences and work towards an amicable settlement agreement.
        
        What is Divorce Mediation?
        Divorce mediation puts the decision-making power in your hands, not some stranger’s who wears a robe to work. This alternative dispute resolution method lets divorcing spouses sit down with a neutral third-party—a mediator—to resolve issues ranging from child support to property division without stepping foot in family court.
        
        The beauty of this process lies in its flexibility; it can adapt to fit unique situations that couples face during the emotionally charged divorce proceedings. Plus, because mediators are neutral facilitators rather than decision-makers, they help people find common ground and help them come to their own agreements.
        
        The Role of a Divorce Mediator
        A divorce mediator isn’t there to take sides or make judgments. They’re like Switzerland—totally neutral but incredibly helpful. Their main objective is to guide conversations so each person can express what they want and need out of the settlement agreement safely and constructively while minimizing the levels of conflict.
        
        This neutrality helps keep emotions at bay as you figure out everything from parenting plans for shared children to how financial matters will be handled post-divorce—all crucial elements for success in mediated divorces.
        
        Advantages of Choosing Mediation Over Litigation

        Ditching litigation for mediation could save you more than just money—it could save your sanity too. By choosing private mediation over public courtroom battles (which often turn adversarial), many folks have found themselves breathing easier thanks to less emotional stress.
        
        Faster resolution: On average, families wrap up these sessions within 6 months tops.
        Saving big bucks: When compared with traditional lawyer-led fights, most see savings between 40% – 60%, meaning potentially thousands stay in your pocket instead going towards legal fees.
        Mediated divorces aren’t just good options—they’re smart ones, especially if time is tight or resources are limited.
        
        In Dallas alone, countless successful family mediations demostrate why it’s a worthy option to consider. So before deciding to take that trek through a traditional contested divorce, give some thought to whether mediation might be a better option for you.
        
        Key Takeaway: 
        
        Mediation can be your peacekeeper in divorce, letting you call the shots and avoid court drama. It’s flexible, keeps things cool, and could save time and money—a win-win for a smoother split.
        
        The Role of Divorce Lawyers in Litigated Divorces
        Legal Advice and Representation
        A divorce lawyer stands as a guide through the tangled forest of family law. When emotions run high, these seasoned professionals ensure you don’t lose your way. They’re more than just legal experts; they are advocates who fight for your rights, especially when the path to agreement is overgrown with discord.

        With a wealth of knowledge on everything from child custody to spousal support, these attorneys help people tackle complex issues that often arise during divorce proceedings. It’s not simply about knowing the law—it’s about applying it strategically to safeguard what matters most to their clients.
        
        In contested divorces where spouses clash over assets or parenting plans, having an attorney in your corner can help you reach the outcome you desire.
        
        Navigating Contested Divorces
        Litigation isn’t anyone’s first choice; but sometimes it’s inevitable. In cases where former partners can’t see eye-to-eye—whether due to financial matters or deep-seated disagreements—a skilled attorney becomes indispensable. They deftly handle every volley in this adversarial legal process: drafting pleadings, managing discovery requests and responses, representing you at trial if needed.
        
        Family court battles aren’t just fought with legal briefs though; there’s also a psychological element at play. A good family law attorney knows this well and will work tirelessly behind scenes so that when push comes to shove—in negotiations or before a judge—their client is poised for success rather than caught off guard by unforeseen challenges.
        
        Divorce lawyers, trained within rigorous law school programs, become essential allies because they possess both detailed legal expertise and courtroom experience that only professionals have gained through practice—not theory alone—which helps them navigate litigation smoothly despite its complexities.

        Key Takeaway: 
        
        Divorce lawyers are your champions in the legal and emotional battleground of a litigated divorce. They blend deep legal knowledge with strategic action to protect what you value most.
        
        Their courtroom savvy can turn the tide in contested divorces, giving you an edge when agreements seem impossible and stakes are high.
        
        Cost Comparison Between Mediation and Litigation
        Average Costs of Mediation vs. Litigation
        Divorce can put a strain on your finances as much as it does on your emotions. When you’re at the crossroads, knowing how to save money on divorce while still achieving a fair outcome is crucial. That’s where understanding the cost-effective divorce options of mediation versus litigation comes in.
        
        In Dallas, like elsewhere across the country, couples face an average bill ranging from $15,000 to $30,000 for litigated divorces—a hefty price tag that underscores the adversarial nature of such proceedings. Contrast this with mediated divorces where costs are significantly lower; often leading to savings between 40% and 60%. A mediator helps people by serving as a neutral party who guides them through resolving the issues without taking sides—potentially saving thousands.
        
        Mediation isn’t just about cutting costs though—it also involves less time than typical court battles. The collaborative process typically wraps up within three to six months which means legal fees don’t pile up over years like they do with drawn-out court cases.

        The American Bar Association highlights mediation as not only being more affordable but also allowing parties control over their outcomes—an empowering aspect when navigating through difficult times like divorce.
        
        Litigation stacks up differently financially because every hour spent in family court or wrangling paperwork contributes to escalating attorney bills—one reason why some might prefer settling out of court via private mediation sessions conducted by professionally trained individuals.
        
        It’s essential then for those facing divorce proceedings to weigh these differences carefully before deciding which route best aligns with both their financial limitations and desired results.
